# Vamoose! Backend

This is the Node.js (Express) backend for Vamoose!, a personalized trip planner that helps users manage trips, invite members, handle expenses, and more.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
- **Hosting**: Google Cloud Run
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Containerization**: Docker

## üìÇ Project Structure

The backend is located in the `server/` folder of the repository. It follows a structured layout:

| Folder         | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/`      | Contains Prisma Client configuration for database interaction.                                                 |
| `controllers/` | Handles business logic for trips, members, invitations, and expenses.                                          |
| `interfaces/`  | Defines TypeScript interfaces for better type safety.                                                          |
| `middleware/`  | Contains custom middleware, including `authMiddleware` (JWT authentication) and validators (input validation). |
| `models/`      | Contains Prisma-based models that interact with the PostgreSQL database.                                       |
| `routes/`      | Defines Express API routes, with `appRouter.ts` serving as the main `/api` entry point.                        |
| `utils/`       | Includes custom error handling utilities.                                                                      |
| `tests/`       | Contains integration tests and unit tests for controllers, models, and middleware, using Jest.                 |
| `cron/`        | Contains cron job to schedule notifications                                                                    |
| `db/`          | Contains connection for mongodb                                                                                |

## ÔøΩ Getting Started

### üìå Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- npm
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vamoose.git
   cd vamoose/server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Backend

### üîß Development Mode

To start the backend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

### üöÄ Production Mode

To build and start the production server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## üåç Environment Variables

The backend uses Supabase authentication & PostgreSQL. Configure these in a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
# Database connection
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
DIRECT_URL="your-direct-database-url"

# Supabase JWT secret for authentication
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

In `.env.local` (used for local dev):

```env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL='https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co'
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='your-anon-key'
```

## üê≥ Docker Setup

### üì¶ Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t vamoose-backend .
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 vamoose-backend
```

The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running the Full Application with Docker

To run both the **frontend** and **server** together using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Stopping the Application

Press **CTRL + C** or run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## üß™ Testing

The backend uses Jest for both unit testing and integration testing.

### üõ† Running All Tests

To run all tests (unit and integration):

```bash
npm run test
```

### üîç Running Unit Tests

Unit tests run in isolation to validate individual functions and components. To run only the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### üîó Running Integration Tests

Integration tests run against a PostgreSQL and Mongo test databases that are launched in Docker. To run integration tests:

1. **Ensure Docker is installed and running.**

2. Create a `.env.test` file in the `server/` directory with the following variables:

    ```env
    DIRECT_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5433/tests"
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prisma:prisma@localhost:5433/tests"
    MONGO_TEST_URI="mongodb://mongo:mongo@localhost:27018/tests?authSource=admin&directConnection=true"
    SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="Super-secret-key"
    ```

3. Run the integration tests:

    ```bash
    npm run test:integration
    ```


## üìè Linting & Formatting

- **Linting**:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Prettier Formatting**:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
